# Anime Diary API

A work in progress that utilizes the Jikan API to pull anime pages from myanimelist and allows visitors to keep a short-term thoughts on the anime they are consuming using local storage.


## How It's Made:
I utilized an excellent design by 
[Utilizing HTML5 Design](https://html5up.net/) (I'm no designer.)

I also used the incredible API 
[Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) as the backbone API

## Lessons Learned :
Not to lean too much on JavaScript creating elements as stated in [MDN Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript):

>Using too much JavaScript is a possible problem. Sometimes you'll see a website where everything has been done with JavaScript â€” the HTML has been generated by JavaScript, the CSS has been generated by JavaScript, etc. This has all kinds of accessibility and other issues associated with it, so it is not advised.
